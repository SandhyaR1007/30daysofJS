#Things I learnt today

1. Array.map() - This method let's you iterate over a given array and return the items.
2. Array.filter()- This method let's you filter out those values from an array that match the condition provided.
3. Array.sort() - This method let's you sort array in ascending or descending based on given parameters.
4. Array.from() - This method creates a shallow copied Array instance from an iterable or array like object. Shallow copy means creating a new instance from the reference such that both new and reference point to the same address in memory. So in case we modify new created instance, the changes will also reflect in reference.
5. Array.reduce(callbackFn,initialValue) - This method let's you perform the given operation on an array and returns a single value.
6. console.table() - This method let's you console output in the form on table.
